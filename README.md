# Fantasy-Baseball-Web-Scrape
Wrote a program to automatically collect the data needed to score my fantasy team from baseball reference, calculate the results, and store the information for later analysis. The scoring system used for this fantasy league I belong to is unusual, and therefore we track the players by hand, so I wrote this to do it automatically to save time.
